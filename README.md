# Python_PRSLS

A Paper-Roc-Scissors-Lizard-Spock Logic in python during a Coursera Interactive Python course via Rice University. 

The "Paper-Roc-Scissors-Lizard-Spock" game is an expanded-choice version of the well-known "Paper-Rock-Scissors" party game 
created by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla and mentioned in the Big 
Bang Theory sitcom series.

The program calculates five instances where the "Player" and "Computer" compete, giving also the correct results.

The program works in Python 2.7.
